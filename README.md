# feature-maker
Just thinking about project management and why its so hard.
So this right now is just a placeholder with some thoughts to get them landed from my brain.
Feeling mildly inspired to start a new project since I've been idle for over a year now. 
And I'd like to hold myself accountable to something for making progress vs abandoning todo lists or other tools/projects. 
So why not write my own tool. 

# How to use this repo
I'll end up building an actual application here soon and the organization of this readme will change towards one where you run software. 
I think I currently have two main goals.
One is to hang up my shingle as a developer who would like to help businesses grow by adding to their capabilities. 
The second is to create a tool that helps track the status of building a feature starting from an idea. 


# rambling
Was reading an article about managing different employee types and what support people need when they fall into a pattern or archetype. ... 
But really was thinking about how much people dislike jira and how an open communication system like slack and pairing it with realtime statuses enables remote work to be more productive... 
How does an org chart play into which people are working on what, and how does knowledege fail to flow through a system to where it needs to be to inform better decision making 
Can you truly fix an organization with the tools that exist today

But I digress. 

# Next steps 
To talk about building a feature we need to talk about what has been done and what remains to be done, as well as how to plan what needs to be done... I think I'll start with the summary of what was recently done.

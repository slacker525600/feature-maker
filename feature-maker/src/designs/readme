how do I want to do designs. 

uml diagrams aren't great, can start with photos of whiteboards or pngs 

idea to layout vs idea to architecture

idea to design and concept with relation to architecture to implementation 

draw a picture, pick a symbol or sketch or photo upload 
drag and drop movement ideal 
all pictures must be named
